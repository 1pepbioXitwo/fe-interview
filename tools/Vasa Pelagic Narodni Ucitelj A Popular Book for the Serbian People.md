## Vasa Pelagic's Life and Struggles
 
Vasa Pelagic was born in 1833 in Gornji Å½abar, a village in Bosnia, then part of the Ottoman Empire. He belonged to a middle-class Serb family and received his primary education in his native village. He then attended a high school in Sarajevo, where he showed interest in literature, history, and philosophy. He moved to Belgrade in 1853 and enrolled in the Faculty of Theology at the Grandes Ã©coles, the precursor of the University of Belgrade. He graduated in 1857 and became a teacher and a priest.
 
Pelagic was not satisfied with the conservative and clerical education he received at the Faculty of Theology. He wanted to learn more about the modern sciences and the social movements that were shaking Europe at that time. He decided to go to Russia, where he hoped to find a more progressive and liberal environment. He studied political medicine and history of medicine at the Moscow State University from 1863 to 1865. He was influenced by the Russian revolutionary democrats, who advocated for social justice, national liberation, and democratic reforms.
 
Pelagic returned to Bosnia in 1865 and became the rector of the newly founded Serbian Orthodox Seminary in Banja Luka. There he taught his students not only theology, but also natural sciences, history, geography, and gymnastics. He also preached progressive ideas and encouraged his students to participate in the national and social liberation movement of the Serbs. He founded a Serbian reading room in Banja Luka, one of the first cultural institutions of its kind in Bosnia. He also wrote pamphlets and books that criticized the Ottoman rule and promoted Serbian nationalism and socialism.
 
Pelagic's activities soon attracted the attention and hostility of the Ottoman authorities, who considered him a dangerous rebel and agitator. He was arrested in 1869 and accused of spreading nationalism, teaching gymnastics, and inciting rebellion. He was sentenced to exile and imprisonment in Asia Minor, where he spent more than two years in harsh conditions. He was released in 1871 thanks to the intervention of Russia, which was an ally of Serbia.
 
Pelagic moved to Serbia, where he continued his political and educational work. He participated in the Serbo-Turkish War of 1876-1878 as a volunteer and a medical officer. He also took part in the Bosnian Uprising of 1875-1878, which aimed to liberate Bosnia from the Ottoman Empire. However, after the Congress of Berlin in 1878, which granted Bosnia to Austria-Hungary as an occupation zone, Pelagic was arrested by the Austro-Hungarian authorities and interned in Hungary for two years.
 
After his release, Pelagic settled again in Serbia, where he became one of the leaders of the socialist movement. He founded the Socialist Association of Serbia in 1880 and organized the first celebrations of May Day (International Workers' Day) in Serbia in 1889. He also wrote extensively on various topics such as history, politics, economics, education, health, morality, religion, and culture. His most famous work is Narodni Ucitelj (The People's Teacher), which was first published in 1873 and went through several editions during his lifetime. The book was a comprehensive guide for the common people on how to improve their physical and mental health, their knowledge and skills, their social and political awareness, and their national and cultural identity.
 
Pelagic's life was marked by constant struggles against oppression and injustice. He was persecuted by both the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian authorities for his revolutionary activities. He was also opposed by some conservative elements within the Serbian society for his radical views. He spent his last years in prison in PoÅ¾arevac, where he died on January 25th 1899.
